The goal of gpkg is to provide a proof-of-concept reader for SQLite queries into [Arrow C Data interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html) structures.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gpkg from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/gpkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem (test SQL courtesy of the [duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/) tests):

```{r example}
library(gpkg)

con <- gpkg_open()
gpkg_exec(con, "CREATE TABLE crossfit (exercise text, difficulty_level int)")
gpkg_exec(con, "INSERT INTO crossfit VALUES ('Push Ups', 3), ('Pull Ups', 5) , ('Push Jerk', 7), ('Bar Muscle Up', 10)")

# Query to Table
gpkg_query_table(con, "SELECT * from crossfit where difficulty_level >= 5")

# ...or directly to data.frame:
gpkg_query(con, "SELECT * from crossfit where difficulty_level >= 5")
```
